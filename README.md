# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) written in Elixir.

This project serves as a test of **Claude Sonnet 4**'s code generation capabilities for Elixir. All solutions are generated by Claude to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of AI-assisted Elixir development.

## Setup

This project requires Elixir 1.18+ and Mix.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/claytonflesher/advent_of_code_2025.git
cd advent_of_code_2025

# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Run tests
mix test

# Run a specific day's solution
mix run -e "IO.puts(AdventOfCode2025.Day01.part1(AdventOfCode2025.Day01.read_input()))"
```

**Total Stars: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (6/48)**

### Day 1: Secret Entrance

**Problem**: Simulate a safe dial with rotations and count when it points to 0.

- **Part 1**: Count how many times the dial ends at position 0 after rotations
- **Part 2**: Count every click that causes the dial to point at 0 (including during rotations)

**Key insights**:
- Dial positions are 0-99 in a circle (modular arithmetic)
- Part 2 requires tracking intermediate positions during each rotation
- Large rotations can pass through 0 multiple times

### Day 2: Gift Shop

**Problem**: Detect invalid product IDs based on repeated character patterns.

- **Part 1**: Count IDs with exact repetitions (same character, same count)
- **Part 2**: Count IDs with flexible repetitions (same character, any count ≥ original)

### Day 3: Lobby

**Problem**: Optimize battery bank configurations to maximize joltage output.

- **Part 1**: Select exactly 2 batteries from each bank to maximize 2-digit joltage
- **Part 2**: Select exactly 12 batteries from each bank to maximize 12-digit joltage

**Key insights**:
- Part 1 uses combinatorial search for small selections
- Part 2 uses greedy "remove k digits" algorithm for efficiency
- Maintaining positional order is crucial for maximizing numerical value
- Algorithm scales from 15-digit sample banks to 100-digit actual input

## Running Solutions

Each day's module follows the same pattern:

```elixir
# Run part 1
AdventOfCode2025.Day01.part1(AdventOfCode2025.Day01.read_input())

# Run part 2  
AdventOfCode2025.Day01.part2(AdventOfCode2025.Day01.read_input())

# Test with sample input
AdventOfCode2025.Day01.part1("L68\nL30\nR48\n...")
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test

# Run tests for a specific day
mix test test/day01_test.exs

# Run tests with verbose output
mix test --trace
```

## Adding New Days

Each day follows a consistent structure:

1. Create `lib/dayXX.ex` with the solution module
2. Create `test/dayXX_test.exs` with tests
3. Add input file to `inputs/dayXX.txt`
4. Update this README
